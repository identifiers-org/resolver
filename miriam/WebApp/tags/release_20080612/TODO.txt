TODO LIST:

- 20080612, Cam: have a browsing page displaying only a subset of the available data types
- 20080611, Cam: update XML schema to match the 'obsolete' feature
- 20080611, Cam: after the update of a data type, instead of displaying the result in a specific page, use the mdb?section=browse&data=MIR:000000XX with a message (update successful, error, ...) to the user
- 20080611, Cam: when publishing a data type, do a basic ckeck to be sure that the data type in the curation pipeline doesn't already exist in the public website
- 20080610, Cam: test link in curator interface dynamic using javascript (can manage update of the values and still point to the update location) 
- 20080610, Cam: find a much better way to manage the functions (diff and generateId) which are present in DataTypeHybernate and CuraDataTypeDao (but only slightly different): it is like that because I am in a hurry right now... 
- 20080609, Cam: finish edition of examples of annotation (deletion, creation)
- 20080513, Cam: create custom tags 'hasCuratorRights' and 'hasAdminRights' and use them in JSP like 'dynamic_browse.jsp'
- 20080513, Cam: update the Web Services and the library to manage obsolete data types
- 20080513, Cam: update the XML export to show if a data type is obsolete
- 20080509, NLN, Nick Juty: in submission form add a "term of use" field or more advanced way to explain this aspect of a data type
- 20080417, Camille Laibe, Michael Hucka: automatically detect that a resource is down
- 20080417, Camille Laibe, NLN: explicite FAQ and "HowTo use the resources" with screenshot (how to edit a data type, ...)
- 200803??, Camille Laibe: encodes "&" by "&amp;" in the submission form
- 200803??, Camille Laibe: encode all reserved characters (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URLEncoder.html)
- 20080325, Nick Juty: copyright notice (accession/usage/redistribution to the data) for each data type, based on a small list (restricted, limited for free, free for all, download, reuse, redistribution). 
- 20080324, Chen Li: add methods to Web Services: data type URI/ name -> data type ID
- 2008032?, Nick Juty: ontology of data type? (with browsing by terms...)
- 2008032?, Camille Laibe, Nick Juty, Chen Li: issue?: one ressource only provide information for a subset of the data type. Example: PDB and PDB of transmembrane proteins.
- 200803??, Camille Laibe: "how to use the resources" pages, for edition, Web Services, ... with screen shots
- 20080226, Nicolas Le Novère: documentation with UML/class diagram, gant charts, ... 


Priority??
Sub tasks??


- "tags" mechanism for resource + browsing by tags (use of a small ontology for that purpose)
- manage the different role of user in a better way (anonymous, curator, administrator)
- curator interface for managing queue of submissions/editions
- ServletDataTypeAdd.java
  - remove the "http://www.pubmed.gov/#" and other "http://www.doi.org/" which are hard coded ==> retrieve that from the DB!
  - add the setting 'obsolete' for a resource in the edit interface (instead of the current 'delete')
-  in DataTypeHYbernate only commit the update/creation of a data type if all the SQL queries have been successful --> CAN'T BE DONE ANY MORE: NOT USING InnoDB any more (NFS issues)


DONE:
- 20080611 -> publication of a data type from the curation pipeline to the public website
           -> improvement of the interface of the curation pipeline
           -> improvement of the cloud tags
           -> XML export with deprecation notification for data types
           -> bug fixed: update of a data type (public and in curation) didn't take into account the example of identifier

- 20080610 -> update last modification date of the data type when editing the tags and the examples of annotation
           -> data type submission curation (display of the 'pending' data types, edition and publication of these)

- 20080609 -> secure the page 'mdb?section=edit_tag&data=MIR:0000000?' 
           -> addition of a new example of annotation to a data type (with ajax)

- 20080608 -> deletion of tags
           -> bug fixed for the browsing of data types based on several tags (now return a true result)
           -> addition of existing tag
           -> addition of new tag
           -> bug fixed in the menu (access to documents/media)

- 20080604 -> edit form for tag management (logged users) (but no actions implemented)
           -> support page: available from the left menu but also used for anonymous users while editing tags or annotation (with simple spam detection)

- 20080602 -> display of a proper "tag cloud" with size of the tags proportional to their number of occurrence + check box to select several and a search button

- 20080526 -> tags display
           -> browsing by tags

- 20080518 -> curator view of pending data types (edition of a pending data type doesn't fully implemented yet)
- 20080518 -> error page if request for a data type which doesn't exist explaining it

- 20080516 -> extremely simple administration console

- 20080515 -> custom menus (normal users, curators, administrators) with access to restricted features
- 20080515 -> new Front Controller internals: cleaner, better performance

- 20080514 -> - 20080325, Nicolas Le Novère: search feature. -> basic search (looks into data types, sysnonyms and resources) 

- 20080513 -> 20080512, Camille Laibe: be able to update the user info (by the user himself)
- 20080513 -> 200803??, Nicolas Le Novère: notification deprecated "replaced by/instead you can use..."
- 20080512 -> 20030401, Camille Laibe: separate database for user rights management (with passwords encoded with SHA, several possible roles per user (for BioModels, for MIRIAM, for SBO, admin, curator, ...), ...)
- 20080512 -> 20080425, Camille Laibe, Nick Juty: change subject of email notification: add the name of the data type (add/edit)

- 200805?? -> 200803??, Nick Juty: add example of identifiers (linked to one resource, not one data type in case the manage different subsets).add a example of identifier for each resource (with a physical link generated in the browsing interface)

- 20080506 (they can't use our Web Services, they need more flexibility, cf email 'Re: Database name' from franckv@ebi.ac.uk) -> 200803??, Nicolas Le Novère: contact External Services (Frank Valentin) to explain the usage of MIRIAM Resources
- 20080417 -> 20080328 (from the past), Camille Laibe: update the XML export adding the example annotations.
- 20080407 -> 200803??, Nick Juty: emails notifications to several people (admin, curators, ...)
- 20080320 - new qualifier "occursIn" added in MIRIAM + news updated
- dump InnoDB engine for MyISAM: too many issues while using it with NFS (locks not released)


PROBABLY DONE:
- update send email (search with "admin.email") + CC  
- finish example of identifier management
- dedicated authentication DB
- update password page



PROBABLY OBSOLETE:

- link to images in static html pages (via a c:import)
The thing I want:
<p>
	<img src="${param.staticPagesAdr}/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>
with an import like that:
<c:import url="${initParam.www}${requestScope.section}" charEncoding="UTF-8"> <%-- var="staticInclude" scope="page" --%>
	<c:param name="staticPagesAdr" value="${initParam.www}" />
</c:import>

The current solution:
<p>
	<img src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/miriam/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>

- think about the "getDataEntries()" method with only one String in parameter 
	and a method to cut the URI in two part (data-type and element identifier)
- perhaps change the search for the physical URLs (based on the MIRIAM URIs) for the data-type browsing
-
