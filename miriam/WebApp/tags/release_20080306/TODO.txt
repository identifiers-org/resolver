TODO LIST:

- "tags" mechanism for resource + browsing by tags
- curator interface for managing queue of submissions/editions
- ServletDataTypeAdd.java
  - remove the "http://www.pubmed.gov/#" and other "http://www.doi.org/" which are hard coded ==> retrieve that from the DB!
  - add the setting 'obsolete' for a resource in the edit interface (instead of the current 'delete')



PROBABLY OBSOLETE:

- link to images in static html pages (via a c:import)
The thing I want:
<p>
	<img src="${param.staticPagesAdr}/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>
with an import like that:
<c:import url="${initParam.www}${requestScope.section}" charEncoding="UTF-8"> <%-- var="staticInclude" scope="page" --%>
	<c:param name="staticPagesAdr" value="${initParam.www}" />
</c:import>

The current solution:
<p>
	<img src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/miriam/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>

- think about the "getDataEntries()" method with only one String in parameter 
	and a method to cut the URI in two part (data-type and element identifier)
- perhaps change the search for the physical URLs (based on the MIRIAM URIs) for the data-type browsing
