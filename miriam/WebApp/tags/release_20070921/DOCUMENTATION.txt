Documentation for Miriam Web Application:


(*) Organisation of the source code

- only one directory for the Java code ('src')
- JSPs stored in 'WebContent-version' (where 'version' equals 'demo' or 'main')
  The differences are:
  - sid and alpha need to include 'head.html' and 'foot.html' with a full path
  - the <h1> tag, for the title, shows the version, except for 'main'
  - some javscript code to access to static elements (images)
- static pages (stub to be included by 'static.jsp') stored in 'static_html' in subfolders according to the version.
  The differences are:
  - path to static elements
  - path to WSDL, JavaDoc, libraries, and dependancies for the Web Services page
- Log4J properties file, stored in 'properties' in subfolders according to the version.


(*) Compile et deploy the application:

- an Ant file is available for all the version, called 'build-version.xml' (where 'version' equals 'demo' or 'main')
- all the war regenerated are stored in 'dist'
