TODO LIST:

- 20080903, Nick Juty: add an email notification while editing the name and definition of a tag (ServletTagEditInfo)
- 20080831, NLN: update front page of MIRIAM Resources (focus on Resources not Standard -put it on the dedicated page-, link to publiations, explanations of the 4 parts of the resources -database, web services, library, web app-)

- 20080801, Nick Juty: keep preferences for the paged browsing (in a cookie?)

- license/usage information for each data type
- 20080731, NLN: create synonyms of tags (the could would only display one)?
- way to merge several tags in one
- 20080703, Luisa Montecchi: tabular export of the list of tags associated with each data type
by data type:
SELECT d.name, d.datatype_id, t.tag FROM mir_tag t, mir_datatype d, mir_tag_link l WHERE ((d.datatype_id = l.ptr_datatype) AND (t.id = l.ptr_tag)) ORDER BY d.name
by tag:
SELECT t.tag, d.name, d.datatype_id FROM mir_tag t, mir_datatype d, mir_tag_link l WHERE ((d.datatype_id = l.ptr_datatype) AND (t.id = l.ptr_tag)) ORDER BY t.tag
by tag (simple):
SELECT t.tag, d.name FROM mir_tag t, mir_datatype d, mir_tag_link l WHERE ((d.datatype_id = l.ptr_datatype) AND (t.id = l.ptr_tag)) ORDER BY t.tag, d.name
- 20080619, All: update "web services demo" page: new title (Annotation Services, URI Services, Online Services, Using Resources, ...), better names for methods, add new methods and remove obsolete ones
- 20080619, NLN: be able to performed a search based on several words (and, or, ....)

- 20080612, Chen Li: modify the "query" page: change the name 'web services demo' ("Using Resources", "Online Services", "URI Services", "Annotation Services", ...), remove the obsolete methods, make it easier to use, show new methods
- 20080611, Cam: after the update of a data type, instead of displaying the result in a specific page, use the mdb?section=browse&data=MIR:000000XX with a message (update successful, error, ...) to the user
- 20080611, Cam: when publishing a data type, do a basic check to be sure that the data type in the curation pipeline doesn't already exist in the public website 
- 20080610, Cam: find a much better way to manage the functions (diff and generateId) which are present in DataTypeHybernate and CuraDataTypeDao (but only slightly different): it is like that because I am in a hurry right now... 
- 20080609, Cam: finish edition of examples of annotation (deletion, creation)
- 20080513, Cam: create custom tags 'hasCuratorRights' and 'hasAdminRights' and use them in JSP like 'dynamic_browse.jsp'

- 200803??, Camille Laibe: encode all reserved characters (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URLEncoder.html)
- 20080325, Nick Juty: copyright notice (accession/usage/redistribution to the data) for each data type, based on a small list (restricted, limited for free, free for all, download, reuse, redistribution). 
- 20080324, Chen Li: add methods to Web Services: data type URI/ name -> data type ID
- 2008032?, Camille Laibe, Nick Juty, Chen Li: issue?: one ressource only provide information for a subset of the data type. Example: PDB and PDB of transmembrane proteins.
- 200803??, Camille Laibe: "how to use the resources" pages, for edition, Web Services, ... with screen shots
- 20080226, Nicolas Le Novère: documentation with UML/class diagram, gant charts, ... 


Priority??
Sub tasks??


- manage the different role of user in a better way (anonymous, curator, administrator)
- ServletDataTypeAdd.java
  - remove the "http://www.pubmed.gov/#" and other "http://www.doi.org/" which are hard coded ==> retrieve that from the DB!
  - add the setting 'obsolete' for a resource in the edit interface (instead of the current 'delete')
-  in DataTypeHybernate only commit the update/creation of a data type if all the SQL queries have been successful --> CAN'T BE DONE ANY MORE: NOT USING InnoDB any more (NFS issues)


DECISIONS:
- 20080619 -> no need to store the version of the format for the examples of annotation (NLN)
- 20080??? -> 2008032?, Nick Juty: ontology of data type? (with browsing by terms...) -> no need for an ontology, simple tags should be enough (NLN)

- 200805?? -> 200803??, Nick Juty: add example of identifiers (linked to one resource, not one data type in case the manage different subsets).add a example of identifier for each resource (with a physical link generated in the browsing interface)

- 20080506 (they can't use our Web Services, they need more flexibility, cf email 'Re: Database name' from franckv@ebi.ac.uk) -> 200803??, Nicolas Le Novère: contact External Services (Frank Valentin) to explain the usage of MIRIAM Resources

PROBABLY DONE:
- update send email (search with "admin.email") + CC  
- finish example of identifier management
- dedicated authentication DB
- update password page



PROBABLY OBSOLETE:

- link to images in static html pages (via a c:import)
The thing I want:
<p>
	<img src="${param.staticPagesAdr}/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>
with an import like that:
<c:import url="${initParam.www}${requestScope.section}" charEncoding="UTF-8"> <%-- var="staticInclude" scope="page" --%>
	<c:param name="staticPagesAdr" value="${initParam.www}" />
</c:import>

The current solution:
<p>
	<img src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/miriam/img/Delete.gif" title="Testing!" alt="Testing!" height="16" width="16" />
</p>

- think about the "getDataEntries()" method with only one String in parameter 
	and a method to cut the URI in two part (data-type and element identifier)
- perhaps change the search for the physical URLs (based on the MIRIAM URIs) for the data-type browsing
-
